### A Javascript Library for HTML Canvas Games using ExtJS 4 

Sorry, no documentation as yet. Best thing is to have a look at a game... so far just Asteroids is done.

My plan is to develop the library by developing games using it, and adding features & refactoring in the process. 

Because changes to the library may break older games, I am creating a branch for each game, named after it. So if you try a game and
it does not work, try switching to the branch for the game and try again.

There is no optimized code yet, so it may take a while to load all the classes for the game. At some point I will make build scripts for
compressed version of the code.

Wont work in IE < 9... will be using Chrome Frame as fallback for non Canvas enabled IEs. VML may work, but will be too slow for gameplay.
