## CanvaSteroids

### A Javascript Library for HTML Canvas Games using ExtJS 4 

Sorry, no documentation as yet. Best thing is to have a look at a game... so far just Asteroids is done.

My plan is to develop the library by developing games using it, and adding features & refactoring in the process. 

Wont work in IE < 9... will be using Chrome Frame as fallback for non Canvas enabled IEs.
